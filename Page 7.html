				Model and fashion influencer Kim Jones has husband Jericho Rosales' full support
		<br>		when it comes to chasing her dreams.
				
				<br>
				<br>
								
				Rosales made this clear when he replied to a critic who hit her for choosing not
		<br> 	to have a baby yet.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				In his Instagram post on Christmas, Rosales replied to a netizen who said Jones 
		<br>		should be a "real woman" and get pregnant.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Can't even (be) with you all the time coz she's busy traveling and fulfilling her
		<br>		dreams. If she's a wonder woman for you @jerichorosalesofficial she should get pregnant 
		<br>		and be a real woman!!!" the netizen said.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				She was replying to Rosales' post showing him and his wife looking at a Christmas tree. 
		<br>		It was captioned, "Christ, you rock."
				
				<br>
				<br>
							
				Rosales, however, gently refuted the statement. He said he is proud that Jones,
		<br>		who runs a blog and has more than 700,000 followers on Instagram, is chasing her 
		<br>		dreams.	
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
			The two married in 2014.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				"I don't think getting preggy and having babies is the only measure for bein
		<br>		"Makes me really proud. Have the best holiday season and peace and love to you 
		<br>		from us."

				<br>
				<br>
				
				The commenter has since deleted her post. However, Twitter user Elisa Aquino
		<br>		posted a screenshot of it and wrote: "A real man won't make you want to forfeit 
		<br>		your dreams."
					
				<br>
				<br>
							
								
				The post, has been retweeted more than 2,000 times and liked more than 11,000
		<br>		times as of Wednesday.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				Jones expressed how proud she is to be married to a man with Rosales' values.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Thank you, Jericho, for believing that a woman's worth and the measure of a 
		<br>		'real woman' comes from a multitude of qualities," she said in a post on her 
		<br>		Instagram Stories on Wednesday night.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				She added, "Thank you for believing my (read: women's) dreams are worth chasing 
		<br>		whatever they may be. That's my man."

				<br>
				<br>
				
				She also had something to say to those who show disdain for women who are still
		<br>	without child.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Often my response is met with incredulity and scorn. We are all in a state of 
		<br>		transition," she said.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				Netizens are also praising Rosales for his modern stance on marriage.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				"I've always admired Jericho Rosales, but stumbling across an article about him 
		<br>		defending women's choice whether or not to have children made me respect him even 
		<br>		more," Twitter user CJ de Silva said.
					
				<br>
				<br>
							
				Another user, Angel Dei said there should be more men like Rosales.

				<br>
				<br>
				
				"People should stop thinking that a woman's only purpose in this life is to get married
		<br>		and have children," she wrote.
