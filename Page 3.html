				Both beauty pageant fanatics and ordinary spectators were treated to an incredible show Monday morning 
		<br>	as this year's Miss Universe competition displayed the right amount of thrill and excitement.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	From hard-hitting questions to candidates that made history, the annual prestigious beauty contest did 
		<br>	not disappoint.
					
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Philippine bet Catriona Gray emerged as the winner after the three-hour coronation night held in Bangkok,
		<br>	Thailand. She bested 93 other candidates to bring the Mikimoto crown back to the country.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Gray, however, wasn't the only one to steal the show during the pageant proper.
					
				<br>
				<br>	
				
		<br>	Here are some of the candidates who stole the limelight in the Miss Universe 2018
			
				<br>		
				<br>
				
		<br>	Miss Costa Rica gives Steve Harvey a valuable piece of advice
		<br>	Miss Costa Rica Natalia Carvajal captured netizens' attention when she jokingly dished out a valuable
		<br>	piece of advice for the competition host Steve Harvey.
							
				<br>
				<br>			
	
		<br>	During the top 20 interviews, Harvey asked Carvajal-- who is also a television host in her country-- for
		<br>	some advice in their chosen profession. The candidate playfully adhered.
				
				<br>		
				<br>
								
		<br> 	"I think you're doing good, the outfit is fine. The smile is always great. But I have to give you one advice
		<br>	just for the future, just in case. Come closer because I don't want anyone to hear," Carvajal poked fun at the mainstay host. 
				
				<br>
				<br>		
	
		<br>	"If they give you like a really, really important envelope, try to read carefully, okay?"
	
				<br>
				<br>	
				
		<br>	Ya'll just won't let it go, huh?" Harvey then jokingly addressed the audience.
						
				<br>		
				<br>
				
		<br>	Harvey most notably broke the internet in 2015 when he announced the wrong winner during that year's Miss Universe 
		<br>	competition. Miss Colombia was already doing her winner's walk when Harvey reentered the stage and announced that it 
		<br>	was Philippines' Pia Wurtzbach who actually won the competition.
				
				<br>
				<br>
		<br>	Miss Jamaica's jitters?
		<br>	Nerves seemed to get in the way of Miss Jamaica Emily Maddison during her opening statement in the competition.
			
				<br>			
				<br>			
								
		<br>	The 19-year-old candidate paused several times during her speech.
							
				<br>			
				<br>			
		<br>	"I started my Miss Universe journey, despite my insecurities. I know that… I know that I actually started to work on my		
		<br>	insecurities," she said, stumbling over the words.
				
				<br>
				<br>	
								
		<br>	But with the encouragement of the crowd as well as her fellow candidates, Maddison was able to get through the moment.
				
				<br>		
				<br>
					
		<br>	"And now that I've realized that a queen defines her own perfection. I know I have what it takes to inspire, to relate, and 
		<br>	most importantly, to comfort young women across the world and across the universe," she closed.
						
		
				<br>		
				<br>
					
		<br>	Miss Vietnam wins hearts of netizens
		<br>	After getting involved in a controversy with fellow contestants, Miss Vietnam H'Hen Nie stole the limelight during coronation night.
						
		
				<br>		
				<br>
	
		<br>	Netizens complimented the candidate for her sheer confidence as well as for "breaking the society's standards" with her look.
					
				<br>	
				<br>
					
		<br>	"I am an ethnic minority. I'm (expected) to get married at 14 but no. I (got) education from nothing, and here I am. (If) I can do (it), 
		<br>	you can do it," she said in her opening statement.
						
				<br>		
				<br>			
								
		<br>	Before the pageant, Miss Vietnam was thrust into the spotlight after Miss USA Sarah Rose Summers-in a viral clip-- allegedly mocked non-English 
		<br>	speaking Miss Universe contestants.
				
				<br>
				<br>	
				
		<br>	Catriona Gray's Mayon-inspired evening gown
		<br>	It was her signature slow-mo turn during the preliminary swimsuit competition that captured the hearts of spectators.
							
				<br>
				<br>		
		<br>	But on coronation night, Gray stole the show during the evening gown portion.
			
				<br>			
				<br>
				
		<br>	Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray blazed the stage with her fiery Mayon volcano-inspired evening gown. By wearing the Mak Tumang creation, Gray paid
		<br>	homage to her hometown in Albay.
						
				<br>		
				<br>
					
		<br>	In the press conference following her victory, Gray explained she chose a red gown after her mother-- years ago-- dreamed she won Miss Universe wearing 
		<br>	a red dress.
				
				<br>
				<br>	
		
		<br>	During the Top 5 portion, Gray's red ensemble literally stood out in a sea of silver.
					
				<br>
				<br>
					
		<br>	Miss Spain makes history
		<br>	Miss Spain Angela Ponce made history as the first ever transwoman to walk the stage in the history of the pageant.
				

				<br>		
				<br>			
				
		<br>	"I have been limited to not being able to do as many things as I would have liked to," she said in Spanish during the pageant's special feature. "So I 
		<br>	developed the ability to create, to dream, that someday I could make it a reality. I feel like I have done that being here today."
				
				<br>		
				<br>			
						
		<br>	Ponce failed to crack the Top 15, but she won the hearts not only of her community, but also of the viewers from around the world.
					
				<br>			
				<br>
				
		<br>	During a special final walk, Ponce strutted in the pageant runway, removed her sash, and proudly raised it high like a flag. The gesture earned her a 
		<br>	standing ovation from the crowd in attendance.
				
				<br>		
				<br>		
				
		<br>	"I don't need to win Miss Universe. I just need to be here," she said after the competition.
