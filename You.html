		<p class="p2">You give me hope,
			<br>The strength, the will to keep on;
			<br>No one else can make me feel this way
			<br>And only you
			<br>Can bring out all the best I can do;
			<br>I believe you turn the tide
			<br>And make me feel real good inside.
			<br><br>
			<br>You pushed me up
			<br>When I'm about to give up;
			<br>You're on my side when no one seems to listen
			<br>And if you go,
			<br>You know the tears can't help but show
			<br>You'll break this heart and tear it apart;
			<br>Then suddenly the madness starts
			<br><br>
		</p>	
			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus:</h4>
			
			
		<p class="p2">It's your smile,
			<br>Your face, your lips that I miss,
			<br>Those sweet little eyes that stare at me
			<br>And make me stay,
			<br>I'm with you through all the way.
			<br>'Cause it's you
			<br>Who fills the emptiness in me;
			<br>It changes ev'rything, you see,
			<br>When I know I've got you with me
			<br><br>
