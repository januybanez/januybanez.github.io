				I am the youngest of the family and small guy with a height of 5'3". And I am a kind of person which is of course afraid of <br> heavenly father,
				adventurous, singer, helpful,respect and hard worker. Because, I see myself the way that I take an action,
				like I go to <br> church every sunday not only that, I also pray every day. I also go some places that I never
				seen before and also I love singing, especial <br> when I go to the bathroom or in my room. Then I help my family 
				even I don't have a job, but I clean the house, help my father doing such <br> things like make mailbox, gutter and etc.
				Then I also respect my family and friends or people surround me, because I don't have a right to <br> judge people.
				and lastly, hard working person like I don't succeed such things for example researching for programming problems,
				making <br> gutter, gate, and also I am a welder of my father's work, installation and making mailbox. I don't forget
				my personal hobbies like playing <br> dota when I am alone in the house but I have time management, playing badminton every 
				sunday and also I love playing chess.

				But, before anything else way back past time I just want to know my previous educated.
				Since elementary I studied at Lapu <br> - Lapu City Central Elementary School. I am so young, cute 
				and happy person with no problem at all, only food when get hungry because I <br> have no money that 
				time. I don't have any awards of my school because, I am a boy scout member at that time to serve
				for my school to <br> clean then environment, teaching throwing garbage proper and self-respect to others,
				after all I fulfil my elementary days and I graduated. <br> Then after elementary of course next chapter 
				of life I enrol high school name Pajo National High School. I'm so bless that I enrol that <br> school
				because I don't  like private school, for me my observation is people in private school are indolent.
				They don't volunteer to clean the <br> environment, rooms and etc. Because they have their own janitors in private
				but in public we volunteer to clean our school and  that is only <br> my thoughts but i was wrong they also clean 
				the school. When I enter my school people are there are very friendly, kind and generous. and <br>
				also teachers, then after that I succeed all level Like 1st year to 4th year until I graduated high school.
				After that I don't proceed collage it's <br> because I'm afraid or terrified so I stop 1 year since 2010,
				I'm so confuse that time because I don't know what course I enter so my father <br> told me "take the BSEE"
				or (Bachelor Of Science in Elecrical Engineering) at UCLM (University of Cebu Lapu - Lapu and Mandaue).<br>
				Then I started enter UCLM at the year of 2011 taking up a course of BSEE.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	
				My studying years at UCLM (University of Cebu Lapu - Lapu and Mandaue) is not that stable
				meaning irregular student, <br> because due to financial problem. So, I studied for 6 years standing 
				of 3rd year collage 1st semester. Then, currently I shift my course into <br> BSIT (Bachelor of Science 
				of Information TechnologY). But before that, I stop studying for just 1 year due to financial problem.
				for my 1 <br> year I'm looking for job to pay my tuition worth 50 thousand pesos until I finally hired.
				My work is a promodiser, Pony shoes which is a <br> marketing professional responsible for demonstrating the
				features of a product to an audience or client. And it shows how the product <br> works, takes questions and attempts
				to persuade consumers or clients to buy the product, at Gaisano Grand mall of Mactan. Working as a <br> promodiser
				is difficult, because lots of people testing my product I also demonstrate etc. then after all they say 
				"thank you!" they don't buy <br> it. But it's ok, for me it shows me more demonstrate or other words improve
				yourself or level up and be patient.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				
				After challenging of life like work as a promodiser, I stop working because I reach the 50 thousand 
				tuition. I am so blessed <br> because my oldest brother sponsored me and he is a graduating in UCLM taking
				of BSIE and his job is a call center agent or BPO industry. <br> After that I continue studying but I transfer
				UC-Main taking a course of BSIT (Bachelor of Science in Information Technology) Standing <br> 1st year collage.
				So today I'm so happy and bless, and I hope in god's blessing if I fulfil my studies I promise myself to help 
				my family for <br> the financial problem. And so I need to work hard or study hard so that I can pass any exam so
				that my parents and bothers will proud of <br> me. So currently I'm focusing this subject like WEB-DEV 
				( Web Delevopment ) because this subject makes me feel better like any other <br> subject. And maybe this subject
				will improve my skills especially typing and encoding, and I love doing it and it makes me proud. And that <br> is 
				my story of life.
