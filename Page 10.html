				 The Palace on Monday said those who will renew their Philippine passports should not be saddled by the submission of requirements 
		<br>		 after the personal data breach.
				
				<br>
				<br>
								
				"Applicants should not be burdened by submitting original copies of their certificates of live birth, which requires another application 
		<br>		process before the Philippine Statistics Authority, to renew their passports just because the producer lost their relevant data," 
		<br>		Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo said in a statement.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) earlier said applicants renewing their green and maroon passports are required to bring their birth 
		<br>		certificates so the agency can store their information on their database; those with dark brown e-passports are excluded. This new requirement
		<br>		comes after the DFA revealed on Saturday that an outsourced passport maker took government data before it was terminated.

				Palace said presenting the expiring passport should be enough.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"The submission of the old or current passport which the applicant seeks to renew should suffice for the purpose. The ongoing practice is not 
		<br>		only cumbersome to everyone affected but is a form of red tape which this administration frowns upon and will not tolerate," Panelo said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The spokesperson said the passport data mess is a "grave matter" and should not be taken lightly. The National Privacy Commission (NPC) is set
		<br>		to investigate the matter.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"The investigation should not, however, end here since the current arrangement for the printing of passports should also be examined to determine if
		<br>		there are violations of pertinent laws which may be detrimental to the public," Panelo said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana on Sunday raised alarm on the passport mess, considering personal data of Filipinos are exposed.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"These are personal information such as full name, date and place of birth, and other information that could be used illegally. We will get in touch
		<br>		with the DFA to find out the details of this issue and how to mitigate its ill effect," he said in a statement.
