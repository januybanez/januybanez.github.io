				The Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) slammed the police for allegedly profiling their members, saying it was a "grossly
		<br>		illegal and unconstitutional attack" on their right to free expression and self-organization.
				
				<br>
				<br>
								
				In a statement released Sunday, ACT said the Philippine National Police (PNP) are "making the rounds in schools and offices 
		<br>		of the Department of Education (DepEd) to press education officials for an inventory of all ACT members under their 
		<br>		jurisdiction."
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				ACT said police either presented or asked school officials to refer to PNP memoranda, so they would give the names of all
		<br>		ACT members in their respective schools. The police, it added, were "citing previous memoranda from PNP Intelligence Departments 
		<br>		and the upcoming elections as bases for the order."
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				ACT, however, did not identify which specific memoranda were cited by the police.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"The operations appear to be of a nationwide scale and points to the top PNP leadership as the foremost source of the order
		<br>		as we received similar reports from our members in Manila, Malabon, Las Pinas, Zambales, Bulacan, Rizal, Mindoro, Sorsogon,
		<br>		Agusan Del Sur, among others," ACT said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The group added it is a legitimate organization and the PNP's actions were a violation not only of its members' rights to free 
		<br>		expression and privacy, but also of the Magna Carta for Public School Teachers.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"The PNP has no business meddling in the affairs of teachers' organizations. Its duty is to serve and protect the people, not 
		<br>		o harass and intimidate activists. Their dastardly act of profiling ACT members is maliciously casting unnecessary doubt on the 
		<br>		legitimacy of ACT as an organization. Moreover, this is also a violation of the right to privacy of every ACT member," 
		<br>		the group said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				ACT is calling on concerned citizens to speak up against "the PNP's "Gestapo-like tactics in repressing progressive sectoral
		<br>		organizations."
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The PNP has not issued a response to the statement of ACT, however PNP Spokesperson Bong Durana told CNN Philippines he "would 
		<br>		check if there was such memo."
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				ACT initially called for a press conference on Monday, January 7, to discuss the issue but called it off after members of the 
		<br>		PNP allegedly gave conflicting information on the veracity of the order profiling ACT members. The group instead would be holding 
		<br>		a protest in front of Camp Crame Monday to confront PNP officials about the matter.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Meanwhile, the Commission on Human Rights (CHR) also lambasted the alleged move of the PNP and called for a clarification on the
		<br>		issue.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				In a statement, CHR spokesperson Jacqueline Ann de Guia said profiling ACT's members is "alarming as it violates rights to privacy
		<br>		and association."
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Should there be clear grounds against ACT and its members, then the police should be transparent in applying the law and equally ensure
		<br>		that due process is observed. Clandestine operations may lead to a number of abuses as it is easier to deny accountability for any action," 
		<br>		she said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"It is important for our police force to stay true to their role as law enforcers. After all, it is their sworn duty to serve and protect 
		<br>		the rights of every Filipino," she added.
