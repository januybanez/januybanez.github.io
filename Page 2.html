				Former Ilocos Sur Governor Luis "Chavit" Singson claimed he has acquired the franchise rights of Miss 
		<br>	Universe (MU) in the Philippines.
				
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	This is contrary to Binibining Pilipinas Charities Inc. (BPCI) chairperson Stella Marquez-Araneta's earlier
		<br>	statement that the organization remains as the official local franchise holder of the pageant.
			
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	In an interview with Philippine Star columnist Wilson Lee Flores, Singson said the franchise "is already 
		<br>	with me," but it has yet to be announced.
				
				<br>
				<br>
								
		<br>	"I think it shall be formally announced this January or February, when Catriona (Gray) comes back again to 
		<br>	the Philippines," he added.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Singson said he has been in talks with the MU Organization regarding the franchise takeover since 2016 when 
		<br>	he help fund the Philippines' hosting of the international pageant.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	"'Binibining Pilipinas Universe' will be replaced with 'Miss Universe Philippines.' Noon pa binibigay sa akin 
		<br>	'yan (It was being offered to me since before), because I've been helping them since 2016," he said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	"Instead of talking to many companies before, they just talked to me and I then gave them a non-refundable deposit 
		<br>	of $1 million. Who would disagree to that, non-refundable? I gained their trust. Before the signing in 2016, they 
		<br>	even first asked me to pay $12 million," he recounted.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Singson even revealed that the international pageant's installation next year will be held in South Korea and North Korea
		<br>	will send a delegate for the first time.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				
		<br>	"The 2019 Miss Universe will be unique because for the first time in history, North Korea will participate but no swimsuit
		<br>	portion for their candidate, only the national costume," he added.
			
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Speculations about the franchise changing hand came when Miss Universe 2018 Catriona Gray went back to the Philippines shortly
		<br>	after winning in Thailand accompanied by Singson and his daughter Richelle Singson-Michael, who was part of the judges during the pageant.
