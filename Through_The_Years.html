		<p class="p2">I can't remember when you weren't there
				<br>When I didn't care for anyone but you
				<br>I swear we've been through everything there is
				<br>Can't imagine anything we've missed
				<br>Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus:</h4>
		<p class="p2">Through the years
				<br>You've never let me down
				<br>You turned my life around
				<br>The sweetest days I've found
				<br>I've found with you
				<br>Through the years
				<br>I've never been afraid
				<br>I've loved the life we've made
				<br>And I'm so glad I've stayed
				<br>Right here with you
				<br>Through the years
</p><br><br>				
				
		<p class="p2">I can't remember what I used to do
				<br>Who I trusted whom, I listened to before
				<br>I swear you've taught me everything I know
				<br>Can't imagine needing someone so
				<br>But through the years it seems to me
				<br>I need you more and more
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus 2:</h4>
		<p class="p2">Through the years
				<br>Through all the good and bad
				<br>I knew how much we had
				<br>I've always been so glad
				<br>To be with you
				<br>Through the years
				<br>It's better everyday
				<br>You've kissed my tears away
				<br>As long as it's okay
				<br>I'll stay with you
				<br>hrough the years
</p><br><br>				
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 3:</h4>	
		<p class="p2">Through the years
				<br>When everything went wrong
				<br>Together we were strong
				<br>I know that I belonged
				<br>Right here with you
				<br>Through the years
				<br>I never had a doubt
				<br>We'd always work things out
				<br>I've learned what love's about
				<br>By loving you
				<br>Through the years
</p><br><br>				
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 4:</h4>	
		<p class="p2">Through the years
				<br>You've never let me down
				<br>You've turned my life around
				<br>The sweetest days I've found
				<br>I've found with you
				<br>Through the years
				<br>It's better everyday
				<br>You've kissed my tears away
				<br>As long as it's okay
				<br>I'll stay with you
				<br>Through the years
				
</p><br><br>
