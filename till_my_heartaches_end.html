		<p class="p2">I recall when you said that you would never leave me
			<br>You told me more,
			<br>so much more like when the time you whispered in my ear
			<br>There was heaven in my heart
			<br>I remember when you said that you'd be here forever
			<br>Then you left without even saying that you're leaving
			<br>I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday
			<br>And I pray that you would stay
			<br>But then you're gone and, oh, so far away
</p>
			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 1:</h4>			
			
		<p class="p2">I was afraid this time would come
			<br>I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within
			<br>I have learned to live my life beside you
			<br>Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight
			<br>And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again
			<br>I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end
</p><br><br><br>
