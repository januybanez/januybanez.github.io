				Filipina actress Ellen Adarna may face legal action after publicly accusing a minor of being a "paparazzi" in a viral video.  
				
				<br>
				<br>
			
		<br>	A Facebook post from Eleila Santos' mother, Myra, said Monday the family has begun seeking legal assistance 
		<br>	regarding the incident and demanded a public apology from the celebrity-actress. 
			
				<br>
				<br>
			
		<br>	"My lawyer indicates that you will have five days to reply to this letter. Should you fail or refuse to do so,
		<br>	we will not hesitate to take the appropriate legal actions necessary under the circumstances, to protect and 
		<br>	uphold the best interest and welfare of our 17 year old, Eleila A. Santos," Myra's statement said. 
				
				<br>
				<br>
			
		<br>	Myra mentioned that her family members have been reaching out to Adarna privately to resolve the issue but
		<br>	instead were shunned by the actress. She said she expected her to act professionally given Adarna's status as
		<br>	a celebrity.
			
			
		<br>	"We initially took it lightly, thinking things would be resolved quickly and the 30-year old you would give the 
		<br>	two minors the benefit of the doubt. Even her aunt wrote a private message to you, and mentioned she is a minor.
		<br>	However, we did not hear anything from you," Myra said. 

				<br>
				<br>				
			
		<br>	After the lack of response, Myra resorted to seeing the video as an attempt to "defame" her daughter. 

				<br>
				<br>			
			
		<br>	"She is my only living child. She is just 17 years old…As much as no one has the right to breach your privacy, 
		<br>	you have no right to ruin my daughter's reputation," the statement said. 

				<br>
				<br>			
			
			
		<br>	Adarna posted her Instagram video explicitly showing Eleila in a Makati restaurant on May 4 with the caption 
		<br>	"When you PAP us, we PAP you. It's a tie. #PAParazziMoves."

				<br>
				<br>

		<br>	Eleila denied the accusation and shared her own video of the incident, insisting she was just focusing the camera 
		<br>	on her bowl of ramen. 

				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Ellen Adarna gained popularity for playing antagonist roles in soap operas. She is currently on hiatus, and is linked
		<br>	to John Lloyd Cruz, another actor whose career is on hold.
