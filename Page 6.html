		<br>		 Foreign Affairs Secretary Teodoro "Teddy Boy" Locsin Jr. on Saturday vowed to expose the culprits behind the alleged
		<br>		 data breach caused by a previous outsourced passport maker.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		"Those behind the passport mess will launch a social media campaign against me. I will identify them," Locsin said in a tweet.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		"Apparently the mess crosses partisan lines," he added.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						

		<br>		In an earlier tweet, Locsin said the issue on the data loss began during the administration of former President and now House
		<br>		Speaker Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo and "got worse" under former President's Benigno Aquino III's term.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		Locsin said the problem will be addressed under his watch.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
						
				
		<br>		The Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) Secretary warned that he will "autopsy" the "yellow crowd" over the incident.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		"I will autopsy the yellows who did the passport deal alive. This is called evisceration," he said.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		Yellow is associated with the Liberal Party, led by Aquino, whose members are known critics of President Rodrigo Duterte.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
					
		<br>		However, Locsin said he will not summon those responsible for the issue, as he will leave the investigation to the Senate and 
		<br>		the Department of Justice (DOJ).
							
						<br>	
						<br>
										
		<br>		"No. I want the problem fixed. Let the Senate investigate and DOJ prosecute if ever," he said as a response to a Twitter user's question.
				
				
		<br>		Locsin's remarks came after he disclosed that an outsourced passport maker took passport applicants' data after its contract was 
		<br>		terminated. He said people opting to renew their passports are now required to bring their birth certificates due to the data loss.

							
						<br>	
						<br>
										
		<br>		The National Privacy Commission said it will look into the issue.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
										
		<br>		Former DFA chief speaks
		<br>		Former Foreign Affairs Secretary Perfecto Yasay Jr. spoke about the issue and revealed that a private company has been illegally producing
		<br>		electronic passports (e-passport) for the DFA.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		In a Facebook post on Saturday, Yasay—a Duterte appointee who served under the position from June 2016 to March 2017—said the issue on 
		<br>		"requiring the already harassed and exasperated applicants to bring their birth certificates and other supporting documents for the renewal 
		<br>		of their passports" due to the breach is "most likely" just part of  a bigger story.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		"But why make the public suffer some more for the misfeasance or wrong of certain government officials?" he asked.
							
						<br>	
						<br>
										
		<br>		According to Yasay, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) and the DFA in August 2006 entered into an agreement on the procurement and centralized 
		<br>		production of machine readable electronic passports (MREP) in line with the standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO).
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		The main part of the project, he said, was awarded to French firm Francois-Charles Oberthur Fiduciare (FCOF) through its local office in Makati City.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		But in October 2015, Yasay said, the DFA entered into a deal with APO Production Unit Inc. (APUI) to produce a new e-passport system "without
		<br>		bidding on condition that no part of the contract can be subcontracted or assigned to a private printer." This happened even if FCOF was producing 
		<br>		passports following ICAO standards.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		"In stark violation of this condition, APUI engaged the services of the United Graphic Expression Corporation (UGEC) for the production of the new 
		<br>		e-passports," he added.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		In February 2017, while Yasay was still the DFA secretary, he said Duterte directed him and Finance Secretary Carlos Dominguez to discuss with the 
		<br>		BSP to return to the central bank the printing of MREPs. The BSP, however, refused to accept the proposal.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		Even Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo, according to Yasay, deemed the assignment of the passport printing to UGEC illegal and even "demanded
		<br>		that all rights over all the personal data, source code, data center and other information" related to e-passport production "be reconveyed to the DFA or be 
		<br>		acknowledged to be exclusively owned and controlled by the DFA."
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		"Upon information and belief, it appears that UGEC which continues the illegal production of the E-passports has not complied," Yasay said.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		He said UGEC cannot be held "accountable for any breach or screw up in the printing of the [e-passports]" under the current "scheme of things."
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		Yasay called for a thorough investigation into the issue.
			
						<br>	
						<br>
						
		<br>		"Indeed this matter should be thoroughly investigated without any political bias or cover-up so that the whole truth, which the public deserves will be exposed,"
		<br>		he said.
