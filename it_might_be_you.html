		<p class="p2">Time, I've been passin' time watchin' trains go by
			<br>Time, I've been passin' time watchin' trains go by
			<br>All of my life
			<br>Lyin' on the sand, watchin' seabirds fly
			<br>Wishing there could be
			<br>Someone waitin' home for me
			<br>Something's telling me it might be you
			<br>All of my life
						<br><br>
			<br>Looking back as lovers go walking past			
			<br>All of my life
			<br>Wondering how they met and what makes it last
			<br>If I found the place
			<br>Would I recognize the face, hoh
			<br>Something's tellin' me it might be you
			<br>Yeah, it's tellin' me it might be you
			<br>So many quiet walks to take
			<br>So many dreams to wake
			<br>And there's so much love to make, hoh hoh
			<br>I think we're gonna need some time
			<br>Maybe all we need is time
			<br>And it's telling me it might be you
			<br>All of my life
						<br><br>
						
			<br>I've been saving love songs and lullabies
			<br>And there's so much more
			<br>No one's ever heard before
			<br>Somethin's tellin' me it might be you
			<br>Yeah, it's tellin' me it must be you
			<br>And I'm feelin' it'll just be you
			<br>All of my life
						<br><br>
						
			<br>I've been waiting for all of my life
			<br>Maybe it's you, maybe it's you
			<br>I've been waiting for all of my life
			<br>Maybe it's you, maybe it's you
			<br>I've been waiting for all of my life
			<br>It's you, it's you
			<br>I've been waiting for all of my life
