		<p class="p2">Hey, hey, hey
			<br>I got a condo in Manhattan
			<br>Baby girl, what's hatnin'?
			<br>You and your ass invited
			<br>So gon' and get to clappin'
			<br>Go pop it for a player, pop-pop it for me
			<br>Turn around and drop it for a player, drop-drop it for me
			<br>I'll rent a beach house in Miami
			<br>Wake up with no jammies (nope)
			<br>Lobster tail for dinner
			<br>Julio, serve that scampi
			<br>You got it if you want it, got, got it if you want it
			<br>Said you got it if you want it, take my wallet if you want it, now
</p><br><br>
			<h4 id="h2">Refrain:</h4>
		<p class="p2">Jump in the Cadillac
			<br>(Girl, let's put some miles on it)
			<br>Anything you want
			<br>(Just to put a smile on you)
			<br>You deserve it baby, you deserve it all
			<br>And I'm gonna give it to you
</p><br><br>			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus:</h4>
		<p class="p2">Cool jewelry shining so bright
			<br>Strawberry champagne on ice
			<br>Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
			<br>Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
			<br>Sex by the fire at night
			<br>Silk sheets and diamonds all white
			<br>Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
			<br>Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like
</p><br><br>
			
		<p class="p2">I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico
			<br>Say the word and we go
			<br>You can be my fleeka
			<br>Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita
			<br>I will never make a promise that I can't keep
			<br>I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave
			<br>Shopping sprees in Paris
			<br>Everything twenty-four karats
			<br>Take a look in that mirror (take a look)
			<br>Now tell me who's the fairest
			<br>Is it you? (is it you?) is it me? (is it me?)
			<br>Say it's us (say it's us) and I'll agree, baby
</p><br><br>

			<br>Well here I am, baby, here I am, baby
			<br>Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me
			<br>Talk to me, tell me what's on your mind
			<br>What's on your mind
			<br>If you want it, girl, come and get it
			<br>All this is here for you
			<br>Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby
			<br>What you tryna do
</p><br><br>			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 3:</h4>
