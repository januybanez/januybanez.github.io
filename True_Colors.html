		<p class="p2">You with the sad eyes
				<br>Don't be discouraged, oh I realize
				<br>It's hard to take courage
				<br>In a world full of people
				<br>You can lose sight of it all
				<br>The darkness inside you
				<br>Can make you feel so small
</p><br><br>		
		<p class="p2">Show me a smile then
				<br>Don't be unhappy
				<br>Can't remember when
				<br>I last saw you laughing
				<br>This world makes you crazy
				<br>And you've taken all you can bear
				<br>Just call me up
				<br>'Cause I will always be there
</p><br><br>				
				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus:</h4>
		<p class="p2">And I see your true colors
				<br>Shining through
				<br>I see your true colors
				<br>And that's why I love you
				<br>So don't be afraid to let them show
				<br>Your true colors
				<br>True colors are beautiful
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus 2:</h4>
		<p class="p2">I see your true colors
				<br>Shining through (true colors)
				<br>I see your true colors
				<br>And that's why I love you
				<br>So don't be afraid to let them show
				<br>Your true colors
				<br>True colors are beautiful (they're beautiful)
				<br>Like a rainbow
</p><br><br>				
				
		<p class="p2">Oh oh oh oh oh like a rainbow
				<br>Ooh can't remember when
				<br>I last saw you laughing
				<br>Ooh oh oh oh
</p><br><br>				
				
		<p class="p2">This world makes you crazy
				<br>And you've taken all you can bear
				<br>Just call me up
				<br>'Cause I will always be there
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus 3:</h4>
		<p class="p2">And I see your true colors
				<br>Shining through
				<br>I see your true colors
				<br>And that's why I love you
				<br>So don't be afraid (don't be afraid) 
				<br>To let them show your true colors
				<br>True colors are beautiful (you're beautiful, oh)
				<br>Like a rainbow
</p><br><br>				
		<p class="p2">Oh oh oh oh oh like a rainbow
				<br>Mmm mmm
