		 		President Rodrigo Duterte said the United States should not expect the Philippines to get into any arms 
		<br>	and military equipment deals with them amid their threats to sanction countries engaging in trade with Russia.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				In a speech before government forces Thursday evening, the President added the U.S. 
		<br>	was also against the Philippines trading with China.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Pagka bumili ka sa [If you purchase from] China o maybe Russia, magsali ka sa [you will join the] (arms)
		<br>	embargo, you cannot trade with America. So para kang inipit doon sa ano. Eh sabi ko naman sa [I told]		 
		<br>	your superiors and the civilian leaders, with that kind of arrangement, do not expect me to buy arms from 
		<br> 	the United States," Duterte said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Instead, the Philippines will look to allies from Israel and South Korea to supply arms, Duterte added.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"I will not agree to buy. Pangit tingnan. Hindi maganda. [It looks bad.] It does not sit well with the Filipino 
		<br>	na ganunin ka tapos pasunod-sunod ka na lang [that they will do something like that and you will just follow]," 
		<br>	he said.
	
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	But Duterte clarified he is not mad at the United States, saying they started it with the sanctions and the heavy 
		<br>	criticism against his administration's war on drugs.
	
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Duterte's statements come a month after Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana said that government is eyeing the purchase of 16 U.S.
		<br>	made Sikorsky Black Hawk combat utility helicopters worth $240 million.		
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	U.S. President Donald Trump on August 2017 signed a law levying new sanctions on countries and entities engaging in transactions with 
		<br>	Russia's defense and intelligence agencies.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>	Trump signed the law in light of Russia's occupation and annexation of the Crimea peninsula, as well as allegations for interfering in
		<br>	the U.S. 2016 presidential elections.
