		<p class="p2">I used to bite my tongue and hold my breath
			<br>cared to rock the boat and make a mess
			<br>So I sat quietly, agreed politely
			<br>I guess that I forgot I had a choice
			<br>I let you push me past the breaking point
			<br>I stood for nothing, so I fell for everything

			<h4 id="h2">Refrain:</h4>
		<p class="p2">You held me down, but I got up (hey!)
			<br>Already brushing off the dust
			<br>You hear my voice, your hear that sound
			<br>Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
			<br>You held me down, but I got up
			<br>Get ready 'cause I had enough
			<br>I see it all, I see it now
</p><br><br>
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus:</h4>
		<p class="p2">I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
			<br>Dancing through the fire
			<br>'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
			<br>Louder, louder than a lion
			<br>'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>You're gonna hear me roar!
</p><br><br>			
			
		<p class="p2">Now I'm floating like a butterfly
			<br>Stinging like a bee I earned my stripes
			<br>I went from zero, to my own hero
</p><br><br>			
			<h4 id="h2">Refrain:</h4>
		<p class="p2">You held me down, but I got up (hey!)
			<br>Already brushing off the dust
			<br>You hear my voice, your hear that sound
			<br>Like thunder, gonna shake the ground
			<br>You held me down, but I got up
			<br>Get ready 'cause I've had enough
			<br>I see it all, I see it now
</p><br><br>			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 2:</h4>
		<p class="p2">I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
			<br>Dancing through the fire
			<br>'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
			<br>Louder, louder than a lion
			<br>'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>You're gonna hear me roar!
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>You're gonna hear me roar!
</p><br><br>			
			
		<p class="p2">Roar, roar, roar, roar, roar!
</p><br><br>
		<h4 id="h2">Chorus 3:</h4>
		<p class="p2">I got the eye of the tiger, a fighter
			<br>Dancing through the fire
			<br>'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar
			<br>Louder, louder than a lion
			<br>'Cause I am a champion, and you're gonna hear me roar!
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>You're gonna hear me roar!
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
			<br>You're gonna hear me roar!
