		<p class="p2">For all the times that you rain on my parade
				<br>And all the clubs you get in using my name
				<br>You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
				<br>You think I'm crying, on my own well I ain't
				<br>And I didn't wanna write a song 
				<br>'cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
				<br>I don't but, you still hit my phone up
				<br>And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
				<br>I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">REFRAIN:</h4>
		<p class="p2">My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
				<br>And I never like to admit that I was wrong
				<br>And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
				<br>And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
</p><br><br>			
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus:</h4>
		<p class="p2">'Cause if you like the way you look that much
				<br>Oh baby you should go and love yourself
				<br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
				<br>You should go and love yourself
</p><br><br>				
				
		<p class="p2">But when you told me that you hated my friends
				<br>The only problem was with you and not them
				<br>And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
				<br>And tried to make me forget where I came from
				<br>And I didn't wanna write a song 
				<br>cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
				<br>I don't but, you still hit my phone up
				<br>And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
				<br>I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">REFRAIN:</h4>
		<p class="p2">My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
				<br>And I never like to admit that I was wrong
				<br>And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
				<br>And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus 2:</h4>
		<p class="p2">'Cause if you like the way you look that much
				<br>Oh baby you should go and love yourself
				<br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
				<br>You should go and love yourself
</p><br><br>				
		<h4 id="h2">......</h4>
</p><br><br>				
				
		<p class="p2">For all the times you made me feel small
				<br>I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
				<br>I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
				<br>Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus 3:</h4>
		<p class="p2">'Cause if you like the way you look that much
				<br>Oh baby you should go and love yourself
				<br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
				<br>You should go and love yourself
</p><br><br>				
				<h4 id="h2">Chorus 4:</h4>
		<p class="p2">'Cause if you like the way you look that much
				<br>Oh baby you should go and love yourself
				<br>And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
				<br>You should go and love yourself
</p><br><br>
