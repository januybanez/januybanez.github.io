		<p class="p2">It's turning out just another day
			<br>I took a shower and I went on my way
			<br>I stopped there as usual
			<br>Had a coffee and pie
			<br>When I turned to leave
			<br>I couldn't believe my eyes
			<br>Standing there I didn't know what to say
			<br>Without one touch we stood there face to face
</p>
			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 1:</h4>				
			
			<p class="p2">And I was dying inside to hold you
			<br>I couldn't believe what I felt for you
			<br>Dying inside, I was dying inside
			<br>But I couldn't bring myself to touch you
</p><br><br><br>				
			
		<p class="p2">You said hello then you asked my name
			<br>I didn't know if I should go all the way
			<br>Inside I felt my life have really changed
			<br>I knew that it would never be the same
			<br>Standing there I didn't know what to say
			<br>First time looked away when I whispered your name
</p>
			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 2:</h4>	
			
		<p class="p2">And I was dying inside to hold you
			<br>I couldn't believe what I felt for you
			<br>Dying inside, I was dying inside
			<br>But I couldn't bring myself to touch you
</p>
			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 3:</h4>				
			
		<p class="p2">And I was dying inside to hold you
			<br>I couldn't believe what I felt for you
			<br>Dying inside, I was dying inside
			<br>But I couldn't bring myself to touch you
</p>
			
			<h4 id="h2">Bridge:</h4>				
			
		<p class="p2">One hello changed my life
			<br>I didn't believe in love at first sight
			<br>But you've shown me what is life
			<br>And now I know my love (I know it's coming right)
			
</p>
			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 4:</h4>		
			
		<p class="p2">And I was dying inside to hold you
			<br>I couldn't believe what I felt for you
			<br>Dying inside, I was dying inside
			<br>But I couldn't bring myself to touch you
</p>
			
			<h4 id="h2">Chorus 5:</h4>	
			
		<p class="p2">And I was dying inside to hold you
			<br>I couldn't believe what I felt for you
			<br>Dying inside, I was dying inside
			<br>But I couldn't bring myself to touch you
