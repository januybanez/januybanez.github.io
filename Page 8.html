					The Philippine National Police (PNP) on Thursday called on the Alliance of Concerned Teachers (ACT) to cut its 
		<br>		supposed ties with the communist group.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				This, as the PNP maintained that the teachers group is a front organization of the Communist Party of the Philippines 
		<br>		(CPP) and its armed wing the New People's Army (NPA).
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Ito ngayon ay isang challenge ko sa (to) ACT sa pamumuno ni Benjie Valbuena na (This is my challenge to ACT under the
		<br>		leadership of Benjie Valbuena) I think, in public, si Mr. Valbuena should start dissociating the ACT from the CPP-NPA that 
		<br>		recently si Joma (Jose Maria) Sison nagsabi sya na (he said that) to oust Duterte that's the priority of the CPP-NPA," PNP 
		<br>		Spokesperson Benigno Duran Jr. said in an interview on CNN Philippines' On The Record.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				He was addressing Valbuena, ACT's secretary general, who was also on the show.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Probably you should start dissociating yourself dahil sinabi mismo ni Joma (because Joma said himself), [and] at the same 
		<br>		time you should also denounce the infiltration, manipulation and the use of our Filipino educators in furtherance of the 
		<br>		evolutionary struggles of the enemies of the state," Duran added.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The spokesperson was citing a video uploaded on YouTube showing a much younger Sison talking about the structure of the CPP, 
		<br>		the National Democratic Front of the Philippines and "legal democratic forces in the Philippines," which include ACT, Kilusang 
		<br>		Mayo Uno, Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas, Gabriela, and the League of Filipino Students.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
		<br>		Valbuena responded to Durana's request, saying doing so is "difficult."
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Mahirap 'yung sinasabi ni Superintendent. Unang una wala namang masamang ginagawa si Joma sa amin at 'yung CPP eh," he said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				[Translation: That's hard to do because Joma and the CPP are not doing any harm to us.]
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				Valbuena said the video should be seen by the public to settle confusions on Sison's address.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				"Dapat siguro makita talaga ng publiko 'yung video.. 30 years ago 'yung video na 'yun. Kung mapapanood natin yun nang walang 
		<br>		distortion, malinaw eh magkaiba 'yung revolutionary forces dun sa legal democratic front," he said.
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				[Translation: The public should really see the video. That was posted 30 years ago. If you watch it without any distortions, 
		<br>		it's clear that the revolutionary forces is different from legal democratic front.]
				
				<br>
				<br>
				
				The dispute between the PNP and ACT stemmed from the latter's complaint of harassment over profiling of its members across 
		<br>		the country.
